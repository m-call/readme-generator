  ## Description
  This application allows the user to quickly generate a high-quality README file for their application using only the command line by using the Inquirer package from NPM as well as the File System methods from Node. This will allow the project creator to allocate more time to working on their actual project rather than spending time on their README file.
  
  The application creates a README file that includes the title of the application, a badge for the license type of the project, a functional table of contents, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, the license type with a link to more information about the license, information on making contributions, information on running tests, and a section for where to direct questions to for anyone that is viewing the README may have. 

  ## Usage
  To use this application, the user must have Node installed on their computer as well as have open some form of a command line.
  
  The user would then navigate through the command line to wherever the project is on their local computer. Then, the user would input the following command into the command line: "node index.js". After inputting that command, the user will be prompted with a series of questions to answer about their project. Once they have answered all the prompts, their README file will be generated!

  ### Example of how to use this application:
